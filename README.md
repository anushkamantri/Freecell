# Freecell Solitaire (Java)
[Code available on request]
This project was developed to interactively play a game of customizable Freecell solitaire with a standard deck of cards through the console. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design was used to build this project, and the final result is a textual interactive game that can be played by entering commands into the console in real time.

### Design

The game begins by shuffling a standard deck of cards, and distributing them into a custom number of cascade piles. Moves can be made from cascade piles to open piles (custom number) or foundation piles (4 piles), or from open piles to cascade or foundation piles. All moves are based on certain restrictions according to the case, such as the color of the card must be the same/opposite and the rank of the card must be exactly one number higher/lower than the previous card. The game is finished once the foundation piles are complete with 13 cards in each pile, all of the same suit and in ascending order of rank.

#### Disclaimer
This project was developed as part of the Object Oriented Design course at Northeastern University. The code will be available on request due to the university honor code.
